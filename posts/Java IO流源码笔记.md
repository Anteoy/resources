### 概览
![diagrams](http://oss.allocmem.com/blog/io.png)
Java中的IO源为4个抽象类，2个字节流相关抽象类InputStream,OutputStream. 2个字符流相关抽象类Reader,Writer.直接联系是都实现了Closeable接口，另外，整个IO的代码基于装饰者模式设计，存在大量的组合 > 聚合 > 关联 > 依赖关系，不了解UML模型图和关系的可以点击[这里](https://blog.csdn.net/dragonpeng2008/article/details/6836448)快速了解。我这里为了UML图的可读性，没有打开dependencies。有兴趣的读者可以自己使用IDEA的diagrams功能查看  
除了抽象类Reader下面的FilterReader是抽象类，其他实现全部是非抽象类。包括缓冲Buffered,数据Data,文件File,字节数组ByteArray,Object,String等各种字节/字符流实现类  
IO实现类中分为两类，一类是被装饰者类，一类是装饰者。被装饰者类就是能够从数据源获取数据的类，比如网络，文件，标准输入/输出等，另一类型是装饰者类，比如BufferedInputStream/BufferedOutputStream等，装饰者类中依赖一个数据源被装饰者类，来实现特定功能，比如缓冲的流读写等，体现在装饰者类的构造函数中需要传入一个被装饰的数据流
字节流抽象类约定的需实现的抽象方法read()返回的是int，即ASCII,而字符流约定需要实现的抽象方法为abstract public int read(char cbuf[], int off, int len) throws IOException;读取字符数据到字符数组cbuf中，返回读取到的字符数int
